HELLO, MY NAME IS LISA.

I’M A VIDEO CREATOR AND ART DIRECTOR WITH A PSYCHOLOGY MASTER DEGREE. I FILM VIDEOS AND HELP BRANDS WITH CREATIVE IDEAS FOR THEIR PROJECTS.
MY WORK INCLUDES SCRIPT WRITING, FILMING PROCCES, EDITING AND COLOR GRADING.
I BELIEVE THAT MY PSYCHOLOGY EDUCATION HELPS ME TO COME UP WITH IDEAS WHICH CAN HELP TO SELL THE PRODUCT AND EVOKE THE NECESSARY PEOPLE EMOTIONS FROM THE CONTENT.

IN THE PAST 3 YEARS I HAVE BEEN WORKING AND SHOOTING VIDEOS ON:
SHORT FASHION VIDEOS, LOOKBOOKS, CAMPAIGNS, INTERVIEWS AND SOCIAL FILMS.

IN MY VIDEOS I PAY A LOT OF ATTENTION TO INTERESTING COLOR COMBINATIONS AND MUSIC.
MOREOVER, I REALLY LIKE TO RAISE SOME INTERESTING SOCIAL TOPIC IN SHORT MOVIES AND THROUGH BEAUTIFUL PICTURES ATTRACT PEOPLE TO USEFUL REFLECTIONS.

NOW I’M OPEN FOR PROJECTS WORLD-WIDE AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HELP YOU WITH ART DIRECTION, NEW CREATIVE IDEAS AND GOOD QUALITY CONTENT FOR YOUR PROJECTS.
